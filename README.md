# Camelot: The Resistance

## Rules Overview
Camelot's rules follow the standard rules for "The Resistance" game, and is based on the expansion and reimagining of the original game: "Avalon." Importantly, though, this game uses very different scoring mechanics and roles from either of these games, and so, in order to play, players will need to get used to the new rules or reference them in the app through the course of play.

## Round Overview

1) **Change the Leader:** The Leader passes thr Leader Token to the next player on their right (or the player named in the Game Start file, if this is the first round).
2) **Pass the Scabbard:** The Scabbard is passed to another player of the wielder's choice (or by the choice of the Leader, if this is the first round). It may not be passed to the Leader or to the previous player to hold it.
3) **Quest Proposal:** The Leader proposes a nunber of players for the next quest equal to the number written on the next quest on the board. Leaders can choose themselves for a quest.
4) **Vote:** The group votes for or against the quest. The vote is a simple majority rules. Ties default to against. If it comes out against, repeat steps 1 and 3. (If this occurs three times in a row, the Evil players gain 3 Victory Points.)
5) **Bestow the Grail:** The Leader selects a player to carry the Grail and the grail is transfered to that player.
6) **The Quest:** The chosen players all provide their cards to the Leader and the cards are shuffled and then revealed.
7) **Results:** The cards are revealed and the results of the quest are determined. All results are applied according to the cards.
8) **Onwards:** Play now returns to step one, though it is often beneficial to briefly discuss the result of the quest.

## Endgame Overview

1) **Assassination:** Evil players reveal themselves and the Assassin determines a target to assassinate. Both the Assassin and chosen target reveal their roles, and both are removed from the rest of the game - namely, the Wild Hunt section.
2) **Wild Hunt:** The remaining players (sans the assassin and their target) all discuss who they believe are Fae. Each remaining player then stands and points at two other players. All players count to three and then all Fae players lower their hands, revealing how many players correctly identified the Fae in the game.
3) **Victory Points:** Victory Points are determined and compared, determining the winner(s) of the gameand the rankings of the players.


## The App
Each player should download the mobile app and input the group code, provided on the host's game screen. Once all players have joined and the game mode has been selected, the app will automatically assign a role to each player and provide character-specific information including your role, allegiance, and origin. Known information about other players is also provided on this screen, as well as misinformation generated by your role or another player's role. This information should be kept private, but can be reviewed at any point during the game by returning to the Role Info tab. After this information has been read and clarified, the game begins with the designated leader selecting the player who holds the scabbard and then choosing players for the first quest.

Some abilities, can be handled through the app, allowing a player to select a target and reveal information as needed. Exile is handled in this way. In these cases, if the ability involves players leaving the room, they should still remove themselves. It is not necessary for players to show one another their phones, as sharing information will happen automatically through the app. Additional information, when applied mid-game, will be displayed as a norification. Known information can be reviewed at any time.

At the end of the game, the Assassination and Wild Hunt can also be handled in the app. Simply have all players click the Wild Hunt button to make their selections. The Assassin will automatically be prompted to select a target, which will be removed from the game and award points accordingly. Once the selections are made, the app will determine final points for each player. Those totals are then passed into a ranking for the game, which is displayed for all players in a descending list.

You may restart the game by exiting the current game and clicking on "New Game." A new code will be provided, which can be distributed to each player. You may also choose to save a copy of the game's details and emailing them to yourself. High scores are saved for each character and preserved in a Hall of Fame for each character role, which can be accessed from the Main Menu.

The app is completed, it will be available here.

## Role Information
At the start of the game, run the program by inputting the names of each player. The game will randomly determine roles and assign them to the inputted names. Open the "Game" folder. Each player should privately open the file with his or her name on it and read it. Players are highly encouraged to take a picture of the document with their phone so they can access that information later, as needed.

### Points
The most important change to the game is the addition of Victory Points, which each player accumulates individually. Players gain points from their role (character), their faction (Arthur or Mordred), and their origin (Mortal or Fae). Players may also lose points if they or another player take or avoid certain actions. Manipulating other players into losing Victory Points while you gain as many as possible is the most integral part of the game.

Some characters have an innate advantage in this respect, with more opportunities to gain points. By the same token, they also have more opportunities to lose points.

### Factions
There are two main factions in the game: the Forces of Arthur (Good) and the Minions of Mordred (Evil). Only one faction can win the Quests portion of the game, which is the main conflict of the game.

#### Arthur's Court (Good)
Arthur's Court comprises the "Good" side of the major conflict. All members of the Good faction earn 3 Victory Points if, at the end of the game, at least three quests succeed.

Arthur's Court usually has less information than the Minions of Mordred, but larger numbers. Members of the Court must attempt to discern each of the roles and determine who is on their side before three quests fail, or they are likely to lose the game.


#### Minions of Mordred (Evil)
The Minions of Mordred comprise the "Evil" side of the major conflict. All members of the Evil faction earn 3 Victory Points if, at the end of the game, at least three quests have failed.

Minions of Mordred are comparatively few in number, but benefit from often knowing who is on their side, and sometimes much more information. Mordred's followers will need to move secretly and manipulate Arthur's superior numbers if they hope to prevent three quests from succeeding, thus improving their scores.

#### Neutral Players
In each game, there is a chance of a Neutral player appearing. Each neutral player has differing goals, but what they all have in common is that they are not innately Good or Evil in the game, and in most cases do not gain or lose points depending on if a Quest succeeds or fails:

##### Sir Kay
Sir Kay is, in fact, not truly neutral, being assigned to one faction at the start of the game, but his player is not made aware of which faction that is. This player is only told one person who is his ally and must intuit that ally's motivations in order to help the correct side.

##### Sir Pelinor and The Questing Beast
This pair are truly neutral in the fight, having no stakes in the battle between good and evil. They will always appear together in a game and their entire goal is to go on the final Quest and prevent the other from attending, as well.



### Origin
There are two possible origins for all players: Mortal and Fae. Fae are the guardians of the mystical world beyond mortal ken, and they are charged with reclaiming holy artifacts for nature while remaining secret. By the end of the game, either the Holy Grail will be corrupted or not. The Fae hope to corrupt and reclaim its holy power, while the mortals must either protect the Grail or capture the Fae. Specifics are listed below.

#### Children of Men (Mortal)
Mortals suffer from a general lack of greatness and magic and so must make use of relics they find, such as the Holy Grail. Mortals may be found both among the Good and Evil forces, but they still must work together to determine where Fae have infiltrated their ranks. During the game, Mortals should be on the lookout for Regrowth (Success) and Rot (Failure) cards, which indicate the presence of Fae.

If the Holy Grail has not yet been corrupted, you can take steps to prevent this corruption by not sending Fae on Quests. If the Grail has already been corrupted, watch your fellow players to determine if they are Fae so you can identify one during the Wild Hunt.


#### The Fairy Court (Fae)
Fae are a magical and jealous group, keeping the world's wonders for themselves. As such, you must attempt to go on enough Quests so that you can play your Regrowth (Success) or Rot (Failure) cards, thus corrupting the Holy Grail. Once the Grail has been corrupted, you will be awarded extra Victory Points, whether or not you participated.

Be aware, if you are identified as Fae during the Wild Hunt (whether or not the Grail has been corrupted), you will lose a significant number of Victory Points, so it is important to keep your role a secret, even after the Grail is corrupted.


### Relics
Relics are powerful items that the players gain access to throughout the game: The Holy Grail and Excalibur. Both of them represent a powerful force in the hands of Arthur and his Court, but also may be used or misused by his enemies to steal victory from his grasp.

#### The Holy Grail
When a player is made the leader, they also gain access to the Holy Grail and can choose to assign the Grail to a single player at the outset of the Quest. Many roles have specific interactions with the Grail, but generally it prevents the chosen player from using Failure cards (or Rot cards, in the case of the Fae).

Beware when using it, however, because Queen Mab is unaffected by the Holy Grail and Sir Bertilak (normally on the side of Good) *must* play Rot while holding it.

#### Excalibur

Excalibur is a major source of power in the game and a source of conflict between good and evil. Excalibur can be in one of three locations: Camelot, The Lake, and The Stone. At the start of the game, place all three Excalibur Location cards in a stack with the starting location on top (as indicated by the Game Start file). Regardless of its starting or later locations, Excalibur may only be claimed in ONE of these locations, determined randomly before the game starts, and only by King Arthur or Sir Accolon, who are on the side of good and evil, respectively.

Arthur and Accolon are not guaranteed to appear either apart or together in any game, but if they obtain Excalibur, their team will be at a significant advantage. Be certain to trust those you allow to obtain the sword.

##### The Scabbard
The Scabbard is part of the Excalibur relic, and starts in the players' hands at the start of the game. At the start of the game, the Leader assigns the Scabbard to one player prior to assigning the first Quest. Each round thereafter, the Scabbard is passed by the person who holds it to any player (except themselves or the player who held it last).

At any point during the round, the player who holds the Scabbard may change the location of the Excalibur search.

## Roles by Player Count
Depending on the number of players, the pool of possible roles will change. This is meant to ensure that both sides are balanced and that no roles create problems. The pool of roles is adjusted automatically by the program.

Your goal is to attend the final quest. If the Questing Beast is on that quest with you, you must use the Battle the Beast ability. If the Questing Beast is NOT on that final quest, you must NOT use the Battle the Beast ability. Performing these actions in the wrong combination will cost you significant Victory Points.

##### Battle the Beast
*Can only be used on the Fifth Quest.*

You may play one Reversal card per game.
        
        
        
## Card Types

#### Success
A vote for a mission to succeed (its default state). This card essentially has no effect, since it will not change the outcome.

#### Failure
Alters the result of a mission to failure. If the mission was already failing, this card has no effect.

#### Regrowth
Works the same as a Success card during a quest. After the quest is over, the Holy Grail moves one step closer to corruption.

#### Rot
Works the same as a Failure card during a quest. After the quest is over, the Holy Grail moves one step closer to corruption.

#### Reverse
This card takes effect after each other card is applied (except other Reversal cards). Each Reversal card reverses the results of the quest. Thus, a failed quest becomes a success, and a successful quest becomes a failure. Two Reversal cards essentially cancel each other out.

This only changes the result of the quest itself and will not affect the corruption of the Holy Grail if Rot or Regrowth are played.

#### Cleanse
If there is a Rot or Regrowth card revealed on this quest, negate all Rot and Regrowth cards. If there are no Rot or Regrowth cards played on this quest, this card counts as a Failure card.

#### The Questing Beast Was Here
Works the same as a Success card.

(This is the primary card played by the Questing Beast and acts as a clue to Sir Pelinor. It, otherwise, has no effect.)



## Notes

Perhaps combine the grail and the scabbard for simplicity. There's a lot of complexity that needs help.

Excalibur locations is also confusing. Maybe they could be castles or areas in trouble.
