# Camelot_The_Resistance

## Rules Overview
The rules for Camelot follow the standard rules for "The Resistance" game, and is based on the game "Avalon." Importantly, though, this game has diverged significantly from the mechanics of either of these games, and so players will need to become accustomed to the new rules.

### Points
The most important change to the game is the addition of Victory Points, which each player accumulates individually. Players gain points from their role (character), their faction (Arthur or Mordred), and their origin (Mortal or Fae). Players may also lose points if they or another player take or avoid certain actions. Manipulating other players into losing Victory Points while you gain as many as possible is the most integral part of the game.

### Factions
There are two main factions in the game: Good and Evil. Only one faction can win the Quests portion of the game, which is the main conflict of the game.

#### Arthur's Court (Good)
