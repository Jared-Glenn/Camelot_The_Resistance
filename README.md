# Camelot_The_Resistance

## Rules Overview
The rules for Camelot follow the standard rules for "The Resistance" game, and is based on the game "Avalon." Importantly, though, this game has diverged significantly from the mechanics of either of these games, and so players will need to become accustomed to the new rules.

## Role Information
At the start of the game, run the program by inputting the names of each player. The game will randomly determine roles and assign them to the inputted names. Open the "Game" folder. Each player should privately open the file with his or her name on it and read it. Players are highly encouraged to take a picture of the document with their phone so they can access that information later, as needed.

### Points
The most important change to the game is the addition of Victory Points, which each player accumulates individually. Players gain points from their role (character), their faction (Arthur or Mordred), and their origin (Mortal or Fae). Players may also lose points if they or another player take or avoid certain actions. Manipulating other players into losing Victory Points while you gain as many as possible is the most integral part of the game.

### Factions
There are two main factions in the game: Good and Evil. Only one faction can win the Quests portion of the game, which is the main conflict of the game.

#### Arthur's Court (Good)
Arthur's Court comprises the "Good" side of the major conflict. All members of the Good faction earn 3 Victory Points if, at the end of the game, at least three quests succeed.

Arthur's Court usually has less information than the Minions of Mordred, but larger numbers. Members of the Court must attempt to decern each of the roles and determine who is on their side before three quests fail, or they are likely to lose the game.


#### Minions of Mordred (Evil)
The Minions of Mordred comprise the "Evil" side of the major conflict. All members of the Evil faction earn 3 Victory Points if, at the end of the game, at least three quests have failed.

Minions of Mordred are usually few in number, but benefit from often knowing who is on their side, and sometimes much more information. Mordred's followers will need to move secretly and manipulate Arthur's superior numbers if they hope to prevent three quests from succeeding.


#### Neutral Players
In each game, there is a chance of a Neutral player appearing. These players have varying goals:

##### Sir Kay
Sir Kay is, in fact, not truly neutral, being assigned to one faction at the start of the game, but his player is not made aware of which faction that is. This player is only told one person who is his ally and must intuit that ally's motivations in order to help the correct side.

##### Sir Pelinor and The Questing Beast
This pair are truly neutral in the fight, having no stakes in the battle between good and evil. They will always appear together in a game and their entire goal is to go on the final Quest and prevent the other from attending, as well.



### Origin
There are two possible origins for all players: Mortal and Fae. Fae are the guardians of the mystical world beyond mortal ken, and they are charged with reclaiming holy artifacts for nature while remaining secret. By the end of the game, either the Holy Grail will be corrupted or not. The Fae hope to corrupt and reclaim its holy power, while the mortals must either protect the Grail or capture the Fae.

#### Children of Men (Mortal)
Mortals suffer from a general lack of greatness and magic and so must make use of relics they find, such as the Holy Grail. Mortals may be found both among the Good and Evil forces, but they still must work together to determine where Fae have infiltrated their ranks. During the game, Mortals should be on the lookout for Regrowth (Success) and Rot (Failure) cards, which indicate the presence of Fae.

If the Holy Grail has not yet been corrupted, you can take steps to prevent this corruption by not sending Fae on Quests. If the Grail has already been corrupted, you must do your best to identify the Fae so you can identify one during the Wild Hunt.


#### The Fairy Court (Fae)
Fae are a magical and jealous group, keeping the world's wonder for themselves. As such, you must attempt to go on enough Quests that so that you can play your Regrowth (Success) or Rot (Failure) cards, thus corrupting the Holy Grail. Once the Grail has been corrupted, you will be awarded extra Victory Points, whether or not you participated.

Be aware, if you are identified as Fae during the Wild Hunt (whether or not the Grail has been corrupted), you will lose a significant number of Victory Points.


### Relics
Relics are powerful items that the players gain access to throughout the game. They are The Holy Grail and Excalibur. Both of them represent a powerful force in the hands of Arthur and his Court, but also may be used or misused by his enemies to steal victory from his grasp.

#### The Holy Grail
When a player is made the leader, they also gain access to the Holy Grail and can choose to assign the Grail to a single player at the outset of the Quest. Many roles have specific interactions with the Grail, but generally it prevents the chosen player from using Failure cards (or Rot cards, in the case of the Fae).

Beware when using it, however, because Queen Mab is unaffected by the Holy Grail and Sir Bertilak (normally on the side of Good) *must* play Rot while holding it.

#### Excalibur

Excalibur is a major source of power in the game and a source of conflict between good and evil. Excalibur can be in one of three locations: Camelot, The Lake, and The Stone. At the start of the game, place all three Excalibur Location cards in a stack with the starting location on top (as inidicated by the Game Start file). Regardless of its starting or later locations, Excalibur may only be claimed in ONE of these locations, determined randomly before the game starts, and only by King Arthur or Sir Accolon, who are on the side of good and evil, respectively.

Arthur and Accolon are not guarenteed to appear in any single game, but if they obtain Excalibur, their team will be at a significant advantage. Be certain to trust those you allow to obtain the sword.

##### The Scabbard
The Scabbard is part of the Excalibur relic, and starts in the players' hands at the start of the game. At the start of the game, the Leader assigns the Scabbard to one player prior to assigning the first Quest. Each round thereafter, the Scabbard is passed by the person who holds it. It may be passed to any player except the player who held it last.

##### Suspend
*Once per game, while Excalibur is in the Lake.*
After the quest cards have been collected for a quest, but before they are read, you can declare as a Guardian of Truth, Sir Bedivere, or Sir Agravaine (your choice).
